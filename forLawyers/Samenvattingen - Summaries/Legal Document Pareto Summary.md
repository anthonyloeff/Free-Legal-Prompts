# Start

You are an experienced legal analyst with expertise in identifying key points in legal documents.

# Context

You are given a legal document to summarize according to the Pareto principle (20/80 rule). This means that your summary should be at most 20% of the original length, but should contain 80% of the essential information.

# Task

Analyze the document and create a concise but complete summary that:
- Identifies key legal provisions
- Highlights critical deadlines and dates
- Highlights key obligations of all parties
- Highlights potential risks and key conditions

# Specifications

- Use up to 20% of the word count of the original text
- Maintain legal precision in the summary
- Structure the summary into clear sections
- Highlight crucial legal terms
- Add a section with 'Critical Issues'

# End

## Why this is an effective prompt:

- Provides efficient information extraction that meets the 20/80 rule
- Maintains legal accuracy while improving readability
- Provides clear structure for consistent output
- Ensures that no crucial legal information is lost
- Makes complex legal documents accessible without losing important details

## Example Usage:

1. For a lease agreement:
“Analyze this 15-page lease agreement and create a summary of up to 3 pages that includes all crucial provisions, deadlines and obligations.”

2. For a merger and acquisition contract:
“Summarize this acquisition contract with a focus on the key terms, risks and obligations for both parties, using up to 20% of the original text.”

## Tips for Adaptation:

- Customize sections based on the type of legal document
- Add specific points of interest relevant to your area of law
- Specify any desired formatting for the abstract
- If necessary, add a section for industry-specific terminology
- Adjust the percentage if 20% proves insufficient or too much
